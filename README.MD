# NeuroNexus 

## Overview

NeuroNexus  is a cutting-edge, theoretical implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence system. It combines concepts from quantum computing, neuroscience, and state-of-the-art machine learning to create a highly sophisticated language model and potential AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) framework.

## Features

- Quantum-inspired tensor networks
- Neuroplastic architecture
- Fractal attention mechanisms
- Adaptive compression and expansion
- Neuro-symbolic reasoning
- Ethical AI framework
- Multimodal fusion (text, image, audio)
- Temporal recursion processing
- Multiversal inference engine
- Meta-learning capabilities
- Self-supervised pretraining
- Quantum-classical hybrid optimization

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- SymPy
- Z3-Solver
- NetworkX
- PyViz
- Matplotlib

## Installation

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use NeuroNexus Omega:

```python
from neuronexus_omega import NeuroNexusOmega

# Initialize the model
model = NeuroNexusOmega(vocab_size=50000, dim=1024, n_qubits=100, n_layers=12, n_heads=16, max_seq_len=512)

# Prepare input data
x = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 100))
image = torch.randn(1, 100, 1024)
audio = torch.randn(1, 100, 1024)

# Forward pass
output = model(x, image, audio)

# Access different outputs
logits = output['output']
ethical_scores = output['ethical_scores']
temporal_output = output['temporal_output']
multiversal_output = output['multiversal_output']
```

For more detailed usage instructions, including training and meta-learning, please refer to the documentation.

## Training

To train the model:

```python
from neuronexus_omega import train_neuronexus_omega

train_neuronexus_omega(model, train_loader, num_epochs=10, device=torch.device("cuda"))
```

For meta-learning:

```python
from neuronexus_omega import meta_train_neuronexus_omega

meta_train_neuronexus_omega(model, task_loader, num_epochs=5, device=torch.device("cuda"))
```
